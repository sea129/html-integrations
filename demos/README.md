# Demos integration

Some kind of esplanation 

## Quick start

Go on the desired editor and run:

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm run build-dev-lerna
```

This is only needed the first time to vinculate the packages of the mono-repositoy on your local directoy.

Every time you do not change any package file, run for init the editor:

```sh
$ npm run build-dev
```

I any package file is changed, run for init the editor:

```sh
$ npm run build-dev-lerna
```
